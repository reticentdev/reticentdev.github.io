# Jesus Teaches Us to Pray 🙏

When we pray, we seek communion with God through conversations with Him.  Prayer IS that conversation! It's raising our minds and hearts ❤️ to God.

## Authentic prayer comes from both the mind AND the heart. 🤔  

We're not just *thinking* about God; we're reaching out to Him with our whole being.

> The heart is the dwelling-place where I am... the place of truth, where we choose life or death. It is the place of encounter... the place of covenant. (CCC 2563)

When we pray, we open our hearts to God and ask Him to come in.  But guess what?  God is already knocking at the door of our hearts! 🚪❤️ Prayer is how we say "Come in!" to God's invitation.

Even though we were made to pray, it can still be tough.  It doesn't always come naturally. 😔 But God gives us strength to persevere, and through Jesus, He teaches us how. 💪

## How Jesus Teaches Us to Pray:

* **Find quiet time:**  Jesus often retreated to a secluded place to pray. 🤫  We need to do the same!  Step away from distractions 📱 and find a quiet space to connect with God.  Even if that quiet place is just in your mind, that counts! 🧠✨

* **Ask and you shall receive:**  "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you." (Matt 7:7-8) 🙏  Jesus reminds us that if we seek God in prayer, we WILL find Him.  

* **Believe in the power of prayer:**  > Just as Jesus prays to the Father... so He teaches us filial boldness: “Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you receive it, and you will.” Such is the power of prayer and of faith that does not doubt: “all things are possible to him who believes.” Jesus is as saddened by the “lack of faith” of his own neighbors and the “little faith” of his own disciples as he is struck with admiration at the great faith of the Roman centurion and the Canaanite woman. (CCC 2610) 🙌  Have faith and trust in the power of prayer!

Prayer is a conversation with God. 🗣️ It takes time and practice to build that relationship.  Just like with your friends, the more you talk to God, the closer you'll become. 😊

All that practice really does pay off. Prayer is always worth the time and effort we put into it. It is worth persevering through the hard parts. Part of that perseverance, though, is humility. In prayer, we approach God Himself, opening our hearts to Him.  We have to realize our own lack of power and accept it. We have to take on the character of little children petitioning their father and not let pride or our own weaknesses get in the way of going to Him, opening our hearts to Him, and receiving the graces He offers us.
